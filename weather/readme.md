# Weather

Part of the building a few things adventure, i decided to build a weather application that call an api [OpenWeather](https://openweathermaps.org)

The purpose was to learn how templating and web servers worked in GO.

There is a city.list.json file in the root directory, it contains all cities (this file was also gotten from the OpenWeather website) there is also a list.json file but it contains some cities to help with faster compile and parsing of the file to structs.

### Clone the app and run with  [ ` go run main.go struct.go ` ]
